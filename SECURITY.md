# Security Policy
>[!IMPORTANT]
> **Please do not report security issues or vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues or create public patches before the issue has been disclosed by the project maintainers.**

If you believe you have discovered a security issue or vulnerability in the TypeScript Toolkit, you can privately report the issue and potentially start privately collaborating on a solution by [drafting a Security Advisory](https://github.com/FusedKush/typescript-toolkit/security/advisories/new) on the project repository on GitHub.

Alternatively, you can privately report the issue to the project maintainers by sending an email to [security@typescript-toolkit.org](mailto:security@typescript-toolkit.org). Please include as much information as possible in your emailed report to help with understanding and resolving the issue, including:
- The type of the issue or vulnerability
- How the issue might be exploited
- The affected source file(s), branch(es), and/or tag(s)
- Any special files or configuration required to exploit the issue
- Instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept code, if possible

Regardless of how you choose to report the issue, you should receive a response within 24-48 hours. If you do not receive a response in that time, please follow up via email to ensure your report was received.
